<a id="Truth" name="Truth"><h2>Truth</h2></a><p>Hint of rumored truth;<br />Lose me in your unrequited chaos<br />Your serene boundary<br />Contains fragmented time<br /><br />At the turn of this mobius life<br />Lies the unanswered question?</p>

<a id="Flame" name="Flame"><h2>Contemplative Flame</h2></a><p>The herb flame<br /><br />not an honest glow<br />but the sharp spines<br />of a lightening cone<br /><br />curving thought suspended<br />from the apex of molten spirits<br />muttering over dead life<br />what a fine way to spend your time</p>

<a id="Metaverse" name="Metaverse"><h2>Metaverse</h2></a><p>A distant thought<br />The reiteration of your presence<br />Sun sets, moon rises<br />Mind meld<br /><br />A warm place<br />The genesis of my dreams<br />Time ebbs, words stay<br />Mood flow<br /><br />An altered state<br />The enigma of desire<br />We meld, We flow<br />Metaverse</p>

<a id="Nightmare" name="Nightmare"><h2>Nightmare</h2></a><p>your lips grew cold<br />your spirit fled<br />i looked and watched<br />i watched with dread<br /><br />my weak hands grasped<br />my skin drew taut<br />i strained for life<br />i vainly sought<br /><br />a withered dream<br />a dying light<br />it fled away<br />into the night</p>

<a id="Eternal" name="Eternal"><h2>Eternal</h2></a><p>It seems not long ago we fell in love<br />And still your passion burns me like a fire<br />Which harms me not; and yet the flames grow higher<br />They set me free - my heart flies like a dove<br /><br />You cooled me like a shower from above<br />A brook, a stream; refreshing when I tire<br />Of loneliness - it's you whom I desire!<br />You quenched my thirst, but still it's not enough!<br /><br />Until the end of time I'll always yearn<br />For ecstasy with you to ever last<br /><br />Beneath the ice a rushing river flows<br />Eternal flames continuously burn<br /><br />Life's weary course may wrench us from our past<br />Our fates may part; our love will never go</p>

<a id="Eurydice" name="Eurydice"><h2>To Eurydice With Love</h2></a><p>My love for you is all consuming,<br />Ever burning, ever blooming<br />Your spirit flew away from me<br />I followed you to set you free<br /><br />From the depths of hell and further<br />Resisting death, surviving murder<br />Bringing back sweet memories<br />With my lyre's quaint melodies<br /><br />Until the god of dreaded death<br />Set you back onto the path<br />We came around the final turn<br />I looked behind, and now you burn</p>

<a id="Graveyard" name="Graveyard"><h2>An Afternoon in the Graveyard</h2></a><p>We walk upon the graves<br />&nbsp;Rotting leaves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling the cracks<br />Quietly death stalks<br /><br />The dilapidated fountain<br />&nbsp;rains no more<br />Wooden crosses of the poor<br />&nbsp;tumbling to the ground<br /><br />Stealthily death stalks<br /><br />Thousands of people dead<br />&nbsp;all they said<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;gone into oblivion<br /><br />We part, going separately<br />&nbsp;on the crossroads<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;of life<br /><br />Quietly death stalks</p>
