Presenting the Grand Opening of <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/aigeanta">Aigeanta's Press</a>, your One Stop Shop for  Stickers and T-Shirts to spread the truth about our descent into a dystopian nightmare. I was inspired by <a href="http://www.opensourceresistance.net/submissions.htm">Open Source Resistance</a> on my first release, "You Can't Win A War Crime". Every purchase you make will help pay the bills the fascists use to keep us too busy to pay attention.
