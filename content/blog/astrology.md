# Summary:
# If the moon can pull our oceans, it can pull our bodies. At the very least, lunar and planetary cycles have some gravitational effect, and solar cycles have magnetic influence on earth's environment. At the most, human civilization has been psychologically influenced by the cosmic rhythm and disasterous disharmonies wrought by the universe.
