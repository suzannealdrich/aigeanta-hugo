I don't think God exists. There is no personality floating out there in space, dictating morality or watching over us. Sorry. There's just no evidence for it. I wouldn't even want a God if there was a possibility. I mean, doesn't it creep you out that there are people who think that their every little action is observed by some old guy in a robe? Sounds like a bunch of exhibitionists to me.
