# Summary:
# I just had an idea...what if you threatened all your friends that if they didn't vote, and didn't threaten all their friends similarly, you wouldn't associate with them anymore? Based on the six degrees of separation principle, wouldn't this get most everybody out to the polls? Or is this an overly hostile action that could backfire and make a bunch of non-voting enemies, or worse, Republicans?
