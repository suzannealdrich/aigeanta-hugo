Today <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/flat/archive/2007/10/12/chronicle/archive/2007/10/12/BAU0SP0L9.html">Al Gore jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his tireless work to bring the issue of global warming to skeptical audiences and provide much-needed leadership. Greenpeace has been campaigning to <a href="http://www.projectthinice.org/">save the polar bear</a>, which is highly threatened by the loss of artic ice caused by global warming: <blockquote>According to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, a study conducted on behalf of the Arctic Council, polar bears "are unlikely to survive as a species if there is an almost complete loss of summer sea-ice cover, which is projected to occur before the end of this century by some climate models."</blockquote>

Unfortunately, it looks like our <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/10/11/94854/280">situation is even worse</a> than the models predicted, so they might become yet another extinct species within a few decades. One way to raise awareness of this seemingly insurmountable problem is to show individual beings who would be negatively affected by the phenomenon, so that we humans can learn how to empathize with their situation. Thus, I would like to share a glimpse into the emotional life of a polar bear, one who just wants to have fun.
