<p>While the president is on a permanent vacation from reality, Vacaville mother Cindy Sheehan has setup Camp Casey outside his Crawford, Texas ranch to protest against an illegal war and occupation that took the life of her son, Casey Sheehan, along with the lives of over 1,850 more American soldiers and probably well over 25,000 Iraqi civilians.
 Her stated reason for the vigil is to meet with Bush to ask, "For what 'noble cause' did my son die?" The Administration's justification for the ill-fated war has shifted repeatedly over the course of 2 years, from protecting us from "mushroom clouds" to "liberating the Iraqi people" (from their bodies?) to "better over there than here". A coalition of like-minded organizations is helping to coordinate a network of <a href="http://www.political.moveon.org/event/cindyvigils/">nationwide vigils</a> to stand in solidarity with Cindy on Wednesday, August 17th at twilight. I am going to participate by showing up at the Sonoma town square with a candle and a sign at 7:30PM tonight; this will be the first time I have ever joined a peace rally in person and it feels right - if Cindy can do it, so can I. A truthful, down-to-earth, commonsense voice is precisely what America needs to be startled from its deadly slumber: a nightmare of fear, ignorance, and violence.</p>
