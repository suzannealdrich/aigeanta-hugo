# Summary:
# My friend has a page of <a href="http://www.kynosoura.com/free-gift-ideas.htm">Free Gift Ideas for the 2003 Holidays</a> that are oriented for those of us who are sickened by the rampant commercialism of the season. There are many opportunities for creative recycling this time of year: for example, re-use last year's gift bags and remember to save packaging for next year, and make ornaments out of dead lightbulbs by painting them and attaching a hanger. Try to remember that the most important gift is your love.
