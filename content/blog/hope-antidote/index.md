The <a href="http://afterdowningstreet.org">grassroots activism surrounding the Downing Street Memo</a> has recently begun to percolate up through the corporate media into newspapers and television. Although the story isn't garnering front page or top-of-the-hour coverage, I am beginning to feel an imminent tidal change in the zeitgeist: finally, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-06-12-poll_x.htm">America is getting a clue</a>. Perhaps the constant barrage of infotainment isn't numbing the masses like it used to.
 After all, you can only distract a man so long with shows starring slutty slack-jaws scampering about before he notices you're simultaneously stealing his savings and sending his sons off to slaughter. Some of my colleagues have expressed a deep cynicism regarding our fascistic government and consumeristic culture. That's what "They" want - for you to give up your dreams and submit to their nightmares. But I believe that hope is the antidote to fear.
