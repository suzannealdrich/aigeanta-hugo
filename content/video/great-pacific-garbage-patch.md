# Summary:
# <blockquote>In the broad expanse of the northern Pacific Ocean, there exists the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, a slowly moving, clockwise spiral of currents created by a high-pressure system of air currents. The area is an oceanic desert, filled with tiny phytoplankton but few big fish or mammals. Due to its lack of large fish and gentle breezes, fishermen and sailors rarely travel through the gyre. But the area is filled with something besides plankton: trash, millions of pounds of it, most of it plastic. It's the largest landfill in the world, and it floats in the middle of the ocean. <cite>-- <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch.htm" title="Why is the world's biggest landfill in the Pacific Ocean?">howstuffworks, "Why is the world's biggest landfill in the Pacific Ocean?"</a></cite></blockquote>
