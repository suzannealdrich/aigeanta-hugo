I hope that 2 weeks from now, John Edwards has a good day in Iowa, because this is a principled individual who I truly believe would stand for the people if elected president. We desperately need strong leadership battling for our interests, instead of the gigantic corporations and ridiculously greedy people who run them (often, into the ground). During the interview, Edwards summarizes his campaign:



<blockquote><strong>EDWARDS:</strong> I’m the guy who’s going to fight for the change we need, not talk about it, not try to maneuver my way through a system that I think is broken.  I’m going to fight for the change.  I’ve been doing it for 54 years of my life.  And I’m the one they can count on to stand up for them. <cite>-- <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna22318762" title="Can Edwards break out from the rest?">MSNBC, "Hardball with Chris Matthews", 12/18/07</a></cite></blockquote>
