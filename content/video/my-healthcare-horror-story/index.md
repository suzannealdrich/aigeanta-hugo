{{< youtube id="vOWjy88eqhk" title="Suzanne - Stories Of Health" >}}

Today is my daughter's first birthday. This weekend we both went to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/8/16/767385/-Videos-outside-of-Pete-Starks-Healthcare-TownhallAn-activist-is-born">Pete Stark's Healthcare Townhall</a> in Fremont to voice our support for a strong public option. Now I want to share with you my story of why I take this so personally. <a href="http://storiesofhealth.org/video/11">Stories of Health</a> is a new website with video diaries of people's health care horror stories. People from all over California told them about their experiences with a system in dire need of reform. I was interviewed in July on a hot day in Oakland, with my baby squirming to get off my lap.
