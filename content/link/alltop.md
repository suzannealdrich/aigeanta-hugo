Explore your passions by collecting stories from “all the top” sites on the web. They’ve grouped these collections -- ”aggregations” -- into individual Alltop sites based on topics such as celebrity gossip, fashion, gaming, sports, politics, automobiles, and Macintosh. At each Alltop site, they display the latest five stories from thirty or more sites on a single page -- they call this “single-page aggregation.”
