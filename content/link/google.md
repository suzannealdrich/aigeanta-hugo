It started out as a graduate project at Stanford University and has grown to almost world-taking-over proportions. Rather than just indexing the words on a site, Google's pioneering search algorithm rated a page's authority by how many links it received, thereby tapping into the distributed power of the web. To this day I tell people to "Google it": this search engine has become part of the lexicon of the Internet forever.
